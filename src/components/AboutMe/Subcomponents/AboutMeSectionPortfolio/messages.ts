			"Welcome to my portfolio website! Creating this website is an exciting hobby that constantly challenges me to test my abilities. This project encourages me to make decisions and face new challenges.\n\nI chose to start the project using React, the framework I primarily work with, but I decided not to limit myself to my comfort zone. I've introduced some small transitions to enhance the site's user experience, and I'm considering the possibility of integrating Three.js to create an interactive game. There's even the possibility of adding a scoreboard.\n\nIn this project, I'm exploring various areas where I've identified gaps, such as deployment and architectural solutions, but perhaps these challenges go beyond the scope of a simple portfolio site. This continuous thought process keeps the site in a state of constant evolution.\n\nCurrently, I consider it a basic project with a strong emphasis on the frontend. I'm already planning to implement server-side rendering (SSR), considering both the use of React Router (already present on the site) and evaluating Next.js as an alternative.\n\nI started this repository a year ago, but it's only in the last three weeks that the site has come to life. I've rediscovered the joy of writing, simply driven by the passion for creation, and I encourage all my fellow developers to do the same.",
